### Question 21 (ID: 21)

**Question:** Correlation with standard screening assessments, i.e., MMSE, MoCA, PACC

**Response:**

The Cognigram assessments have been evaluated for their correlation with standard screening assessments, specifically the MMSE and ADAS-Cog. In a comprehensive study involving a large cohort of older adults, including healthy controls, individuals with biomarker-defined preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD, and AD dementia, the performance scores from Cognigram were compared to these established cognitive assessments. The findings indicated that lower accuracy on Cognigram components such as the OCL, ONB, and LWM tests corresponded with greater impairment as measured by the ADAS-Cog. For example, a score of 93% correct on the ONB test aligned with an ADAS-Cog score of 10, while a score of 72% correct corresponded to a score of 20 on the ADAS-Cog. This demonstrates a significant correlation, suggesting that Cognigram assessments can effectively reflect cognitive impairment levels similar to those identified by standard screening tools like the MMSE. However, specific correlations with the MoCA and PACC are not detailed in the provided context.
