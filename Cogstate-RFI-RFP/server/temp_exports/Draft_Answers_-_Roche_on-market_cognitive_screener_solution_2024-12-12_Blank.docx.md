## 20. Test-retest reliability of screening scores

The test-retest reliability of the screening scores, specifically for the LWM composite derived from the ONB and OCL tests, is high across various groups. In a study involving participants from the AIBL study, the Cogstate brief battery was administered monthly over four months to evaluate this reliability. The results demonstrated high test-retest reliability (r > 0.70) consistently across different groups: healthy controls, individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and those with Alzheimer's dementia. Additionally, the individual ONB and OCL tests also exhibited strong test-retest reliability, even with repeated administrations on the same day, with stability coefficients of p < 0.01 in MCI and AD samples.

---

## 21. Correlation with standard screening assessments, i.e., MMSE, MoCA, PACC

The Cognigram assessments have demonstrated significant correlations with standard cognitive screening tools such as the MMSE and ADAS-Cog. In a comprehensive study involving a large sample of older adults, including healthy controls, individuals with preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD, and AD dementia, performance scores from Cognigram assessments were compared against these traditional measures. Findings indicate that lower accuracy on Cognigram's specific tests, such as the OCL, ONB, and LWM, corresponds to greater impairment on the ADAS-Cog. For instance, a performance score of 93% correct on the ONB test aligns with an ADAS-Cog score of 10, whereas a 72% correct score corresponds to an ADAS-Cog score of 20. This demonstrates that Cognigram assessments can effectively reflect cognitive impairment levels as measured by established screening tools. However, specific correlations with MoCA and PACC are not detailed in the provided documents.

## 22. Correlation with biomarkers, i.e., MRI, PET, pTau181, pTau217

The OCL (Object-Location) and ONB (Object-Name) tests, along with the LWM (Logical Working Memory) composite, demonstrate sensitivity to cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) stages, both preclinical and prodromal, particularly in individuals with elevated beta-amyloid (AÎ²) as indicated by PET scans. These tests reveal accelerated cognitive decline compared to AÎ²- controls. Additionally, changes observed in the LWM composite are associated with reductions in hippocampal volume as seen on MRI scans. However, specific correlations with pTau181 and pTau217 biomarkers are not detailed in the provided knowledge base documents. Therefore, based on the available information, a direct correlation with pTau181 and pTau217 cannot be confirmed.

## 24. Availability of age and education adjusted normative data

The Cogstate normative dataset, updated on October 17, 2024, includes data from over 50,000 individuals, with a specific focus on those aged 65 years and older. This dataset encompasses a broad age range from 4 to 89 years, allowing for age-adjusted normative data. For adults aged 18 to 89 years, the dataset is derived from a healthy population involved in various clinical trials and research studies. These studies include both single assessments and longitudinal designs, although only baseline sessions are included in the normative database. 

For children and adolescents aged 4 to 18 years, the normative data is organized into individual age bins to account for cognitive development changes. This pediatric normative sample is based on dedicated studies and other research efforts.

Regarding education adjustment, performance scores on the One Card Learning (OCL) and One Back (ONB) tests do not require adjustment for education level. A recent study involving 5001 cognitively normal older adults found no significant impact of education on test performance, with any observed effect being trivial.

In summary, while the Cogstate normative data is adjusted for age, it does not require adjustment for education, particularly for the OCL and ONB tests.
